# Lab Exercise 2

## Instructions

Lab Exercise 2 is composed of three parts with several smaller parts. Write up your answers to all three parts in a separate word document and turn it in, **as a hard copy**, by the start of the next Lab on **February 8, 2016**.

## Part I

Fossil species are recognized and classified on the basis of morphology. This introduces subjectivity into the process of classification because all species display some range of morphological variability and the line between intra- and interspecific variability is often a judgment call.

#### Step 1

Click [here](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/Lab2Figures/Figure1.pdf) to see illustrations of 25 ammonoid specimens. Your job will be to group them into species, keeping in mind the potential for intraspecific variability, ontogenetic change, and sexual dimorphism.

#### Step 2
Open the [ammonite_classify.R]() file in R. It is a data file containing shell coiling measurements traditionally used in ammonoid classification, including diameter (D), the ratio of umbilical width U to diameter (U/D), and the ratio of shell width W to diameter (W/D). The file also contains the stratigraphic position of each specimen. Follow the instructions in the R file to classify the specimens and make graphs.

#### Part I Questions

1. Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species).

2. The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative and quantitative traits you think are important.
 
3. The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species

4. The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility (the illustrations and data contain enough information for you to assess sexual dimorphism).

## Part II

Examine the following cladogram and answer the questions.

#### Part II Questions

1.	What is the synapomorphy of the clade containing species D and E?

2.	What is a plesiomorphic character of that clade?

3.	What is the synapomorphy of the clade containing species A and B?

4.	Which taxa have a sulfurous odor?

5.	What character distinguishes species D from species E?

6.	Are adorable eyelashes a synapomorphy or an autapomorphy? 

7.	Traditionally, the five taxa are grouped into three families. Determine if each family is monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic.

Family | Species
--------- | ----------
Family 1 | Contains species A. 
Family 2 | Contains species B and C.
Family 3 | contains species D and E. 

8.	More recently, species A has been grouped in a family with species D and E. Is this advisable? Why or why not?

9.	Determine if the following groups are monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic. 

Group | Species
--------- | ----------
Group 1 | Species A, B, C. 
Group 2 | Species C, D, E. 
Group 3 | Species C and D. 
Group 4 | Species A and B. 
Group 5 | Species B, D, E.

## Part III

The following figure shows the pattern of shape change during ontogeny of the bivalve *Gryphaea arcuata*, from the early juvenile (A) to late juvenile (B) to adult (C). Note the magnification factors of the juvenile stages.

Here are adults of *Gryphaea mccullochi* (D) and *Gryphaea gigantea* (E). They are shown at x1.

The following figure shows the ontogeny of the trilobite Olenellus lapworthi (thin vertical arrow on left) and the evolutionary relationship of five species of Olenellus (large diagonal arrow). What type of heterochrony is represented?

#### Part III Questions

1. Assuming that *Gryphaea arcuata* represents the ancestor, what type of heterochrony is most likely responsible for evolution of these two species? 

2. Which species of *Gryphaea* has undergone a greater degree of heterochrony?

3. What type of heterochrony is represented in the *Ollenus* example??
